Machine Learning Academic Project: IMDB Review Sentiment Classification
Objective:
Classified IMDB movie reviews as "good" (rating >= 7) or "bad" (rating <= 4) using a Naive Bayes classifier on categorical data.

Key Responsibilities and Accomplishments:

Data Visualization and Exploration:

Plotted a grid of histograms (5 columns, 5 rows) to visualize the distribution of the first 25 features.
Histograms included side-by-side bars for class 0 (bad reviews) and class 1 (good reviews).
Titles for each plot denoted the feature number, helping to identify the most and least helpful features for classification.
Feature Selection:

Analyzed histograms to determine the most and least helpful features for Naive Bayes classification.
Identified the top three most helpful features and the least helpful feature based on their distributions.
Naive Bayes Classifier Implementation:

Implemented a Naive Bayes classifier with LaPlace smoothing to handle zero counts.
Trained the classifier using the training data, learning the conditional probabilities of feature values given the class labels.
Prediction and Evaluation:

Developed a prediction function to classify new examples based on the learned Naive Bayes model.
Tested the implementation on sample data to ensure accuracy and robustness.
Technical Skills and Tools:

Programming Languages: Python
Libraries: NumPy, Matplotlib
Machine Learning Concepts: Naive Bayes Classification, LaPlace Smoothing, Data Visualization
